## Overview

[CS144](https://cs144.github.io/) is an introductory course about computer networks. You will learn about the basic principles of computer networks, for example packet switching, layering, encapsulation and protocols; and you will learn how applications such as the world-wide-web, video streaming (e.g. Netflix and Hulu), video conferencing (e.g. Zoom and Skype) and BitTorrent use the network to communicate. You will spend quite a lot of time learning about the specifics of how the Internet works – which is of course by far the biggest computer network ever built. You will learn how applications communicate reliably over an unreliable Internet. And you will build portions of the Internet yourself! In fact, we believe that in CS144 you build more parts of the Internet infrastructure than in any other undergraduate networking class anywhere. It’s really fun to see how the individual pieces work: You build an Internet router, and a reliable data delivery service, and then you use it to communicate with remote servers.
